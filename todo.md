### Should be implemented
1. Add expect operator and magento stock collection to readme
1. Return new id or new object from push

1. Ignore mode - where all errors in data are logging and ignoring and all data without errors are processing
1. Progress display in GUI
1. Converter from any observable to the etl collection
1. Speed control in GUI
1. Sync and get dif support for elements, collections and entire endpoints
1. Order endpoints by categories
1. Move all events from collections to observable (to support have multiple pipes for one collection)

1. Input/output application streams support
1. Add constructor to all files collection to create collection from buffered contents
1. Add archives support
1. Add context to store current process state to restore it after the process restarting
